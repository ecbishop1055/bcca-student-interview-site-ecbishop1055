        <h2>What is Base Camp Coding Academy?</h2>
        <p>Base Camp is an 11 month program for training software developers. The students are fresh out of high school. 
            some with no coding experience and others with coding experience. During their time at the program they will learn to become full stack developers in only a year.
            this is an interview with one of the students describing their experience at the program. </p>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Ethan Bishop and I am also a student currently attending Base Camp. I was tasked with creating this page with a small interview I conducted on a fellow student.</p>
        <h2>The Interview: Evan Sanders (BaseCamp Student)</h2>
        <p>
            What has been the toughest week at BaseCamp? - Evan: "I would say the week that really comes to mind is the week we learned dictionaries in python."</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            What has been the easiest week at BaseCamp? - Evan: "The week we started learning HTML/CSS because it is less demanding than writing and actual python script."
        </p>
        <p>
            What is your biggest victory so far at BaseCamp? - Evan: "The biggest victory personally would be that I managed to make it all the way to the 3rd unit in the program."
